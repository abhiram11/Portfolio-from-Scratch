              This forum enabled us to showcase our product and technology to
              TITAN senior management (Director, Managing Director, CEO, and
              other executives). The forum helped us to discuss and demonstrate
              our project and research work and talk about the product's
              application, growth, and use cases that are to be considered while
              entering the market. The event was full of advanced researchers
              and projects led mainly by PhD scholars and professors
              representing elite institutes across India (IIT Kharagpur, Kanpur,
              Guwahati, IIIT Jabalpur, etc.).

              Health Trail was a three month non-residential accelerator
              programme for healthcare startups hosted by IIM Calcutta and
              Villgro. Got to learn about brand development, market research,
              GTM strategies, balance sheet handling, agreements, and all round
              business knowledge required to grow a startup while networking
              with entrepreneurs all around the country.

              This was one of the toughest startup programme to get selected.
              Our startup, mBreath, got ranked in Top 15 Nationwide Startups in
              India and we represented the company at The Ritz Carlton,
              Bangalore. After the selection in the final round, I learned a bit
              of Android Kernel programming, sensors interfacing with Qualcomm's
              Snapdragon processors, Java Native Interface (C and Java coding
              together), while researching and developing the AI models
              simultaneously. I could not take during the super busy two-day
              event, so here's one from Titan event.
