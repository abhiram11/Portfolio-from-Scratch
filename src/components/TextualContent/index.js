        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I am Abhiram, an experienced Data Scientist in Real Estate and
          Healthcare Industries, and now also a budding Full-Stack Developer!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked as a Data Scientist at two startups each comprising of
          elite individuals, hBits (team of around 12, with grads from Harvard,
          Stanford, Duke, IIT Madras and Bombay, IIM Ahmedabad and Indore, NIT
          Nagpur, and other entrepreneurs), and mBreath Technologies (team of 4
          with myself being the first full-time hire, two IIT Kharagpur PhD
          Scholars and an IIT Kharagpur Professor, along with interns from IIT
          Kharagpur, NIT Raipur, and VIT).
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of my work, I have also been to IIT Kharagpur and IIM
          Calcutta, not as a student, but as an entrepreneur. I have worked
          directly with PhD Scholars and Professors of IIT Kharagpur right after
          my Bachelors!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have learned Full Stack through a practical project-based approach
          where I have updated my consistent progress on platforms such as
          Github, Youtube, and Twitter.
        </p>
        {/* <p>
        With my experience in data science, fast and dynamic start-up culture,
        team management and mentorship, assistance in business development,
        customer profiling, communication and networking, I believe I have the
        knowledge, drive, and technical skills needed to be the perfect addition
        to any technical team.
