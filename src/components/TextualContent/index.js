        I am Abhiram, an experienced Data Scientist in Real Estate and
        Healthcare Industries, and now also a budding Full-Stack Developer!

        I have worked as a Data Scientist at two startups each comprising of
        elite individuals, hBits (team of around 12, with grads from Harvard,
        Stanford, Duke, IIT Madras and Bombay, IIM Ahmedabad and Indore, NIT
        Nagpur, and other entrepreneurs), and mBreath Technologies (team of 4
        with myself being the first full-time hire, two IIT Kharagpur PhD
        Scholars and an IIT Kharagpur Professor, along with interns from IIT
        Kharagpur, NIT Raipur, and VIT).
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of my work, I have also been to IIT Kharagpur and IIM Calcutta,
